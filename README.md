# Provider Confluent

`provider-confluent` is a [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) provider that
is built using [Upjet](https://github.com/upbound/upjet) code
generation tools and exposes XRM-conformant managed resources for the
Confluent API.

## Getting Started

### Fix for make generate
The Confluent Provider Terraform documentation has a missing block that will cause the `make generate` command to fail with the following error:
```shell
scraper: error: Failed to scrape Terraform provider metadata: cannot scrape Terraform registry: failed to scrape resource metadata from path: ../.work/confluentinc/confluent/docs/resources/confluent_ksql_cluster.md: failed to find the prelude of the document using the xpath expressions: //text()[contains(., "description") and contains(., "page_title")]
```

To fix this, run:
```shell
broken_doc_file=".work/confluentinc/confluent/docs/resources/confluent_ksql_cluster.md"
echo '---
# generated by https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs
page_title: "confluent_ksql_cluster Resource - terraform-provider-confluent"
subcategory: ""
description: |-

---' | cat - $broken_doc_file > temp && mv temp $broken_doc_file
```


Install the provider by using the following command after changing the image tag
to the [latest release](https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers/crossplane-contrib/provider-confluent):
```
up ctp provider install crossplane-contrib/provider-confluent:v0.1.0
```

Alternatively, you can use declarative installation:
```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: provider-confluent
spec:
  package: crossplane-contrib/provider-confluent:v0.1.0
EOF
```

Notice that in this example Provider resource is referencing ControllerConfig with debug enabled.

You can see the API reference [here](https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/crossplane-contrib/provider-confluent).
